# Example Experimental Data for CWAVE Recreation
# Time: Time points of measurement (e.g., minutes)
# GLC_Total: Total concentration of Brain Glucose (e.g., mM)
# GLC_Total_SD: Standard deviation for GLC_Total measurement
# LAC_Total: Total concentration of Lactate (e.g., mM)
# LAC_Total_SD: Standard deviation for LAC_Total measurement
# GLN_C4_FE: Fractional Enrichment (0-1) of 13C at Carbon 4 of Glutamine
# GLN_C4_FE_SD: Standard deviation for GLN_C4_FE measurement
# GLU_n_C4_FE: Fractional Enrichment (0-1) of 13C at Carbon 4 of Neuronal Glutamate
# GLU_n_C4_FE_SD: Standard deviation for GLU_n_C4_FE measurement
# Note: The '_SD' suffix is expected by the load_data function in utils/helpers.py
# Note: The variable names (e.g., GLN_C4_FE) must match those expected in fitter.py's mapping.
